                    <p>
                        Ginevra de' Benci is a portrait painting by Leonardo da Vinci of the 
                        15th-century Florentine aristocrat Ginevra de' Benci (born c. 1458). 
                        The oil-on-wood portrait was acquired by the National Gallery of Art in 
                        Washington, D.C. in 1967. The sum of US$5 million—an absolute record price 
                        at the time—came from the Ailsa Mellon Bruce Fund and was paid to the Princely 
                        House of Liechtenstein. It is the only painting by Leonardo on public view in 
                        the Americas.

                    <p>
                        The portrait Lady with an ermine (1489-1490) by Leonardo Da Vinci depicts 
                        Cecilia Gallerani, the teenage mistress of Ludovico Sforza, the regent and 
                        later the Duke of Milan. While some scholars doubted this identification, 
                        ample evidence affirms Cecilia Gallerani is the subject of Lady with an ermine. 
                        The earliest mention of the portrait appears in a sonnet by court poet Bernardo 
                        Bellincioni, in which he notes that it seems as if Cecilia is listening to an 
                        unseen speaker.

                    <p>
                        Leonardo created the illusion of space by using linear perspective – a 
                        technique in which all parallel lines in the painting converge in a single 
                        vanishing point. In The Last Supper, the single vanishing point, at Jesus’s 
                        right temple, draws the viewer’s attention to the main subject in the foreground. 
                        Jesus adorns the traditional blue and red robes, but he has no halo. Some scholars 
                        have suggested that Leonardo alludes to the halo through the shining light from 
                        the window behind Jesus, or the pediment above the window.
