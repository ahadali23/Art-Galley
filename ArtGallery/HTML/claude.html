                        Haystacks is a title of a series of impressionist paintings by Monet. 
                        The primary subjects of all of the paintings in the series are stacks 
                        of hay in the field after the harvest season. The title refers primarily 
                        to a twenty-five canvas series begun at the end of summer of 1890 and 
                        continued through the following spring, using that year's harvest. Some use 
                        a broader definition of the title to refer to other paintings by Monet with 
                        this same theme. The series is known for its thematic use of repetition to show 
                        differences in perception of light across various times of day, seasons, and types 
                        of weather.

                        San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk is a prime example of Claude Monet. Also occasionally 
                        referred to as Sunset in Venice, was painted in the autumn of 1908 in Venice where 
                        Monet and his wife Alice had traveled by their own chauffeur-driven car. They stayed 
                        first at the Palazzo Barbaro and later at the Hotel Brittania. It was here that he 
                        created this masterpiece.

                        Water Lilies is not a name of a single painting, but a name of a series of works. 
                        During his lifetime, Claude Monet comes back to this subject matter several times, 
                        and painted more than 250 water lilies paintings. Along with Starry Night by Vincent 
                        van Gogh, Water Lilies are the most iconic images of Impressionism.The first series of 
                        "Water Lilies," a total of twenty-five canvases, was exhibited at the Galerie Durand-Ruel 
                        in 1900. This was followed nine years later by a second series of forty-eight canvases.
