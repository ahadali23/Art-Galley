                    <h1>The Two Fridas</h1>
                    <p>
                        In this painting, the two Fridas are holding hands. They both have 
                        visible hearts and the heart of the traditional Frida is cut and torn open. 
                        The main artery, which comes from the torn heart down to the right hand of 
                        the traditional Frida, is cut off by the surgical pincers held in the lap of 
                        the traditional Frida. The blood keeps dripping on her white dress and she is 
                        in danger of bleeding to death. The stormy sky filled with agitated clouds may 
                        reflect Frida's inner turmoil.

                <div class="pdiv">
                    <p>
                        In this painting, Frida used a young deer with the head of herself and was fatally 
                        wounded by a bunch of arrows. The background is the forest with dead trees and broken 
                        branches, which implied the feeling of fear and desperation. Far away is the stormy, 
                        lightning-lit sky which brings some hope but the dear will never be able to reach it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Watermelons have hard shells that protect the soft flesh inside. When you bite into 
                        the flesh, you experience cool, juicy sweetness. At its most elemental, a watermelon 
                        could symbolize the artist herself, who had to develop a thick skin to weather a life 
                        marked with physical pain, a troubled marriage to artist Diego Rivera and harsh 
                        criticism of her art.
