                        Dali painted Burning Giraffe before his exile in the United States which was 
                        from 1940 to 1948. Although Dali declared himself apolitical - "I am Dali, 
                        and only that" - this painting shows his personal struggle with the battle 
                        in his home country. Characteristic is the opened drawers in the blue female 
                        figure, which Dali on a later date described as "Femme-coccyx" (tail bone woman). 
                        This phenomenon can be traced back to Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytical method, 
                        much admired by Dali.

                        Dali was both an art and science connoisseur. He held a particular fascination 
                        with the double helix, which appeared in many of his paintings, such as this 
                        painting - Landscape with Butterflies. Although the mere presence of DNA in 
                        Dali's paintings does not hold some deeper meaning, there was a logical reason 
                        that the helixes were included in this painting; Contrary to popular surrealism, 
                        the painting can be logically interpreted.

                        Swans Reflecting Elephants (1937) is from Dali's Paranoiac-critical period. 
                        Painted using oil on canvas, it contains one of Dali's famous double images. 
                        The double images were a major part of Dali's "paranoia-critical method," 
                        which he put forward in his 1935 essay "The Conquest of the Irrational." 
                        He explained his process as a "spontaneous method of irrational understanding 
                        based upon the interpretative critical association of delirious phenomena." 
                        Dali used this method to bring forth the hallucinatory forms, double images 
                        and visual illusions that filled his paintings during the Thirties.
