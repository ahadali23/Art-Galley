                    <h1>Almond Blossom</h1>
                <div class="pdiv">
                    <p>
                        In painting the Almond Blossom, Van Gogh was not out 
                        to revive his own optimism, but to make an offering 
                        to his ever-caring brother. In spring 1889, Theo had
                        married Jo Bonger, and in February 1890 she gave birth 
                        to their son, whom they named Vincent after the boy's godfather. 
                        The Blossoming Almond Tree was van Gogh's present to the infant 
                        that would perpetuate his name. The hope expressed in the painting 
                        is bound up with human life and thoughts of the future. It is not exactly 
                        Utopian in character; rather, the keynote of the painting is longing. 
                        And it is not really a reminiscence of Aries at all - in a sense, 
                        the painting is a celebration of family life, which Vincent the 
                        godfather now felt part of again.

                        The profusion of elements in this close-packed picture is tamed and ordered 
                        for the eye without loss of freedom by the division of the canvas into fairly 
                        distinct, large regions of color approaching symmetry: the cold leaf-green in 
                        the middle, the iris-blue above and beneath, and in two corners the red ground 
                        and the distant warm green, touched with yellow, orange, and white.
                        Most original is the drawing of the irises. Unlike the Impressionist flower 
                        pieces in which the plants are formless spots of color, with the same sincerity and precision
                        as Van Gogh's portraits; he discovers an endless variety of curved silhouettes, a 
                        new source of movement, in what might easily have become a static ornamental 
                        repetition of the same motif.

                        Some of Vincent van Gogh's most famous works are his Sunflower series. 
                        He painted a total of twelve of these canvases, although the most commonly 
                        referred to are the seven he painted while in Arles in 1888 - 1889. The other 
                        five he had painted previously while in Paris in 1887.

                        There are many pieces within this series of paintings (each is clearly 
                        identifiable as a Van Gogh work) in which there are only minor differences 
                        that separate them. The overall layout of the painting along with the positioning 
                        of the actual sunflowers usually remains the same in similar paintings.
