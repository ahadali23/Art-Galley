                        Child with a Dove is one of Picasso's earliest works: he was twenty-one, 
                        or even less, but his own style is already apparent. He probably painted 
                        it in Paris during his second visit, when he was staying with Spanish friends. 
                        By that time he had seen, studied, and assimilated contemporary French painting: 
                        he had taken Toulouse-Lautrec's way of rendering a visual impression rapidly with 
                        a few forceful lines and shrill spots of color, and made it his own. Also, he had 
                        learned from Degas how to observe a figure sharply and with detachment. In Child 
                        with a Dove, we see a new thoughtfulness, a poetic sympathy with the subject, 
                        qualities that were to dominate his work in the years that followed.

                        Landscape painting is rare in Spanish art.This scarcity can be tied to Spanish history. 
                        The Spanish Counter-Reformation of the sixteenth century was staunchly against both 
                        classicism and humanism. Strictly interpreted Catholic doctrine viewed the subject of 
                        human nature and nature in general as corrupt and indulgent. To contemplate the beauty 
                        of nature was to indulge in a hedonistic, pagan, and heretical act.
                        This particular piece was finished in 1952, after Picasso's cubism 
                        style was developed. The choppy shapes remind viewers of a collage, 
                        or synthetic cubism. Synthetic cubism is the use of cut paper fragments, 
                        wallpaper or newspaper, pasted into the composition. This style was developed 
                        along with Georges Braque and it analyzed objects by their shape.

                        In the autumn of 1905, on his return to Paris from Gosol, 
                        Picasso at last succeeded in completing his adamantine Portrait 
                        of Gertrude Stein, which he had begun not long after his first meeting
                        with the American writer.

                        According to Gertrude, she sat for him 'some eighty or ninety' times 
                        before he abandoned it unfinished the following spring, by which time 
                        she and her brother Leo were well on the way to becoming his most important 
                        private patrons.
