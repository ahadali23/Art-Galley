                        Green Stripe, 1905, the depiction of the artist's wife, Amélie, is one of 
                        Matisse's most famous paintings and a masterpiece within 20th century 
                        portraiture.
                        Matisse has used color alone to describe the image. Her oval face is bisected 
                        with a slash of green and her coiffure, purpled and top-knotted, juts against 
                        a frame of three jostling colors. Her right side repeats the vividness of the 
                        intrusive green; on her left, the mauve and orange echo the colors of her dress. 
                        This is Matisse's version of the dress, his creative essay in harmony.

                        Matisse's Open Window, Collioure is an icon of early modernism. A small but 
                        explosive work, it is celebrated as one of the most important early paintings 
                        of the so-called fauve school, a group of artists, including André Derain, 
                        Maurice de Vlaminck, and Georges Braque, that emerged in 1904. Fauve paintings 
                        are distinguished by a startling palette of saturated, unmixed colors and broad 
                        brushstrokes. The effect is one of spontaneity, although the works reveal a 
                        calculated assimilation of techniques from postimpressionism and neo-impressionism. 
                        Open Window represents the very inception of the new manner in Matisse's art. It was 
                        painted in Collioure, a small town on the Mediterranean coast of France to which 
                        Matisse traveled with Derain in the summer of 1905.

                        Matisse turned to a motif common in the painting: a room decorated with vases, fruits 
                        and flowers. Yet, as he wrote in 1908, "the basis of my thinking has not changed, 
                        but the very thinking has evolved and my means of expression have followed on." 
                        The luxuriant raspberry red fabric with its energetic twists of blue pattern seems 
                        to sink down from the wall, taking over the surface of the table and uniting it in 
                        a single whole, swallowing up the three-dimensional space of the room and masterfully 
                        confirming the decorative potential of the canvas surface.
