                        Pollock had created his first "drip" painting in 1947, the product of a radical 
                        new approach to paint handling. With Autumn Rhythm, made in October of 1950, the 
                        artist is at the height of his powers. In this nonrepresentational picture, thinned 
                        paint was applied to unprimed, unstretched canvas that lay flat on the floor rather 
                        than propped on an easel. Poured, dripped, dribbled, scumbled, flicked, and splattered, 
                        the pigment was applied in the most unorthodox means. The artist also used sticks, trowels, 
                        knives, in short, anything but the traditional painter's implement to build up dense, 
                        lyrical compositions comprised of intricate skeins of line.

                    <p>
                        Ocean Greyness, one of Pollock's last great works, depicts several disembodied eyes 
                        hidden within the swirling colored fragments that materialize from the dense, scumbled 
                        gray ground. "When you are painting out of your unconscious", he claimed, "figures are 
                        bound to emerge". Manifest in this painting is a dynamic tension between representation 
                        and abstraction that, finally, constitutes the core of Pollock's multileveled oeuvre.

                        Finished just after Pollock's first exhibition in 1943 at Peggy Guggenheim's New York 
                        gallery, Art of This Century, Pasiphae is the largest of the painter's mythologically 
                        themed pictures of the mid-1940s. Originally named Moby Dick, the picture was retitled 
                        before it was exhibited in 1944 when James Johnson Sweeney, a curator at the Museum of 
                        Modern Art, related the story of the Cretan princess Pasiphae who gave birth to the 
                        half-man, half-bull Minotaur.
