                        In 1936, cosmetics executive Elizabeth Arden commissioned O'Keeffe to paint 
                        Jimson Weed to hang in the exercise room of the new Arden Sports Salon in 
                        New York. The result was the largest of O'Keeffe's flower paintings. The artist 
                        placed the four blossoms in an exuberant design that repeats the tight rhythm of 
                        the pinwheel-shaped plant. She emphasized her subject's fresh beauty with a light, 
                        restricted palette.

                        Among the most dramatic and well-known images of O'Keeffe's later years are her 
                        cloudscapes of the 1960s and '70s. Traveling around the world, she was exhilarated 
                        by the views seen from an airplane window. She described the changing patterns and 
                        colors as "breathtaking" and was moved to interpret these sights and feelings in 
                        paint. At first she painted contemplative pictures that showed the sky covered with 
                        a blanket of solid white clouds; later, a series of lively canvases filled with puffy 
                        white clouds and blue sky that stretch to infinity.

                        In 1958, O'Keeffe painted Ladder to the Moon. The painting shows a handmade wooden 
                        ladder suspended in the turquoise sky. In the background are the pitch-black Pedernal 
                        Mountains and a pearl-colored half-moon. This painting was very similar to a picture 
                        taken of O'Keeffe and her surroundings at Ghost Ranch. In the picture, a large wooden 
                        ladder is leaned against an outer wall of a patio from where it rises up into the sky 
                        with the Pedernal Mountains in the background. Some say her immediate surroundings at 
                        Ghost Ranch were the inspiration for this piece of art. Others interpret the painting 
                        as a religious work.
